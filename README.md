# Phenyl_GA
This code is a genetic algorithm to generate terphenyl derivatives which uses a screening function based on LUMO values of the molecules.

Prerequisites:

QChem
Python packages: 
a. ase 
b. rdkit 
c. pymatgen
Installing: Qchem can be downloaded from http://www.q-chem.com/. IMPORTANT: Qchem requires a license.
All of the above mentioned packages have conda installtions.

Modules:

Multipoint: Crossover operator Takes 2 molecules as SMILES and produces a new molecule with features of both the parent molecules. 
string_mutate: Mutation operator Takes 1 molecule as SMILES and replaces one atom/functional group with another. 
xyz_gen: Takes a SMILES representation and creates a xyz file 
gen: Creates a Qchem input file 
qchem_run: Makes slurm files. (file.run) 
submit_runs: Submits slurm files. 
New_scoring_fn: Assigns scores to molecules based on their LUMO energies.
string_GA: Generates a population of molecules that evolve in each generation(iteration) with increasing values of LUMO energies.
terphenyl.smi: File containing terphenyl SMILES, which are used to make the initial population in string_GA. 

Running: Run the file string_GA.
